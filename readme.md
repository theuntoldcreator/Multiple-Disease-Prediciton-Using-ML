# Multiple Disease Prediction

## Documentation


1) Install Required Libreries From the requirements.txt

> pip install -r requirements.txt


>This will install all the libraries like streamlit , pickle , streamlit_option_menu


2) Open Main.py file and set saved model paths


3) Run Streamlit for the file execution
>streamlit run main.py




4) This will launch the Streamlit web application in your default web browser.


5) Using CSV files in the directory or by manually entering the input features into the web application, provide the values for the input features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and so on.


6) Once you have entered the required input features, the application will use the trained machine learning models to predict the likelihood of the person having diabetes, heart disease, or Parkinson's disease.


#### In summary, the Multiple Disease Prediction application is a user-friendly tool that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes, heart disease, or Parkinson's disease. By following the above steps, users can easily use this application to make informed decisions about their health.
